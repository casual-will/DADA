Week 6 First Lab Write-up
By: Will Kuhn

1. See code
2.top 5 service ports
R's:
Netbios session service, http, POP3, ssh, and DNS.
Datacenter
O's
SMTP, http, ssh, DNS, Microsoft CIFS
work
3. See code
4. It looks like R is corporate with addresses like 10.5.*.*. This agrees with the notion that the R is datacenter related. The other looks like many different addresses which could be an ISP or a datacenter.
5. In R the dominate network prefix is 10.5.63.* and in O it is 192.245.12.*
6. See code
7. It seems as though the addresses 207.182.35.* addresses seemed to be associated with the O data and OSPF traffic.
8. Yes. Since OSPF is router related information being distributed then there is a good chance that it is related to a corporate network with many routers.
9. See code
